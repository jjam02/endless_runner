Our game technically became more involved than class examples. There was implementation of different types of collision, such as Overlap, and setting the offset and sizes for specific sprites.

In the artistic sense, the music and sound effects work well together and properly give the vibe that the game should give. The spritework was also themed well and fit with the background.
